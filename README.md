# Steam Remake

Inspired by Juxtopposed's captivating YouTube video where she re-imagined the Steam UI, our project was born out of the desire to bring that vision to life and provide users with an interactive experience. Motivated by the need to engage with the content showcased in the video, we decided to transform the concept into a web application. Leveraging the power of nodeJS for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend, our project seamlessly integrates design aesthetics with functionality. To enrich the user experience, we integrated the RAWG API, enabling us to fetch comprehensive information about video games, including user reviews, screenshots, and valuable resources. This project represents our commitment to bridging the gap between inspiration and interaction, offering a visually appealing and user-friendly platform for exploring the world of gaming.
